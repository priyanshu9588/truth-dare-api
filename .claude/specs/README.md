# Specs Directory

This directory contains comprehensive project specifications generated by the spec-planner agent.

## Structure

Each feature gets its own subdirectory:
```
specs/
├── feature-name/
│   ├── requirements.md    # Business and technical requirements
│   ├── design.md          # Architecture and design specifications
│   ├── tasks.md           # Task breakdown and tracking
│   ├── research/          # Research findings and documentation
│   └── diagrams/          # Architecture diagrams and visuals
```

## Workflow

1. **New Feature Request** → spec-planner generates specs here
2. **User Approval** → Implementation begins following the specs
3. **Progress Tracking** → Tasks sync with CLAUDE.md
4. **Completion** → Specs serve as project documentation
