# Technology Stack

## Project Type
REST API service built with modern Python web technologies, designed for high-performance social gaming content delivery with comprehensive documentation and monitoring capabilities.

## Core Technologies

### Primary Language(s)
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ (recommended: Python 3.12 for performance improvements)
- **Runtime**: CPython with asyncio support for concurrent request handling
- **Language-specific tools**: pip for package management, virtual environments for isolation

### Key Dependencies/Libraries
- **fastapi[standard]>=0.116.1**: Modern async web framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **uvicorn[standard]>=0.30.0**: High-performance ASGI server for production deployment
- **pydantic-settings>=2.6.0**: Configuration management with environment variable support
- **pydantic>=2.9.0**: Data validation and serialization (included with FastAPI)
- **pytest>=8.0.0**: Modern testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **httpx>=0.27.0**: Async HTTP client for API testing

### Application Architecture
**Layered Architecture** with clear separation of concerns:
- **Routes Layer**: FastAPI routers handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Services Layer**: Business logic for truth/dare/game operations
- **Data Layer**: JSON file storage with in-memory caching via DataCache class
- **Models Layer**: Pydantic response models with validation and documentation
- **Core Layer**: Configuration, exceptions, and cross-cutting concerns
- **Utils Layer**: Shared utilities for data loading and caching

### Data Storage
- **Primary storage**: JSON files (`truths.json`, `dares.json`) with structured content
- **Caching**: Python dictionaries with in-memory caching for performance
- **Data formats**: JSON with UTF-8 encoding, structured by category/difficulty
- **Data access**: Singleton DataCache pattern for consistent data access

### External Integrations
- **APIs**: RESTful HTTP/JSON API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS with CORS support for web applications
- **Authentication**: None currently (stateless API design)
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger UI and ReDoc interfaces

## Development Environment

### Build & Development Tools
- **Build System**: Python setuptools with requirements.txt dependency management
- **Package Management**: pip with separate production and development requirements
- **Development workflow**: FastAPI CLI (`fastapi dev`) with hot reload, uvicorn fallback
- **CLI Commands**: Modern FastAPI 0.116.1+ CLI tools for development and production

### Code Quality Tools
- **Static Analysis**: MyPy for type checking, Ruff for fast linting
- **Formatting**: Black for consistent code formatting
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with async support, httpx for HTTP testing
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs, comprehensive docstrings

### Version Control & Collaboration
- **VCS**: Git with GitHub for collaboration
- **Branching Strategy**: Main branch with feature branches for development
- **Code Review Process**: Pull request based with automated testing

## Deployment & Distribution
- **Target Platform(s)**: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), containerized deployment
- **Distribution Method**: Python package with Docker containerization
- **Installation Requirements**: Python 3.11+, virtual environment, pip dependencies
- **Update Mechanism**: Git-based deployment with CI/CD pipeline support

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for all API endpoints
- **Concurrent Requests**: Handle 1000+ simultaneous requests
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB baseline memory footprint
- **Startup Time**: < 5 seconds for data loading and service initialization

### Compatibility Requirements  
- **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS, Windows (cross-platform Python)
- **Python Versions**: 3.11+ required, 3.12+ recommended
- **Standards Compliance**: OpenAPI 3.0, HTTP/1.1, JSON RFC 7159

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Requirements**: Input validation via Pydantic, secure error handling
- **Data Protection**: No sensitive data storage, stateless design
- **Threat Model**: Focus on input validation, DoS prevention, information disclosure prevention

### Scalability & Reliability
- **Expected Load**: Moderate to high volume API requests
- **Availability Requirements**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Growth Projections**: Horizontal scaling via load balancing, stateless design

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision Log
1. **FastAPI over Flask/Django**: Chosen for automatic OpenAPI documentation, async support, and modern Python type hints integration
2. **JSON File Storage over Database**: Simplifies deployment, reduces dependencies, sufficient for read-heavy static content
3. **In-Memory Caching Strategy**: Eliminates database queries, provides sub-200ms response times, suitable for static content
4. **Pydantic v2 Models**: Provides comprehensive validation, automatic documentation, and excellent IDE support
5. **Uvicorn ASGI Server**: High performance async server suitable for FastAPI applications
6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Custom exception classes provide consistent error responses and debugging capabilities

## Known Limitations
- **Static Content**: Currently limited to pre-defined JSON content, no dynamic content generation
- **No Persistence**: Stateless design means no user sessions, favorites, or history tracking
- **File-based Storage**: Not suitable for user-generated content or high-write scenarios
- **No Authentication**: Open API without rate limiting or user management
- **Single Instance**: Current architecture doesn't support distributed caching or multi-instance data synchronization

## Performance Considerations
- **In-Memory Caching**: All content loaded at startup for optimal response times
- **Async Framework**: FastAPI/Uvicorn provides excellent concurrent request handling
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight dependency set reduces startup time and memory usage
- **JSON Optimization**: Structured data format enables fast parsing and serialization
- **HTTP Optimization**: Proper status codes, content types, and CORS configuration for web performance
