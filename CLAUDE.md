## Agent Configuration for Claude Code

### Primary Agent for ALL Development Tasks
**ALWAYS USE: master-developer-orchestrator**

The master-developer-orchestrator MUST be used for ALL development tasks because it:
- Coordinates all specialized agents automatically
- Maintains context across the entire project
- Ensures security scanning and documentation
- Manages the complete development lifecycle

### Available Agent System (15 Orchestrators + 75+ Power Agents)

**ðŸŽ¯ Planning & Coordination:**
- `spec-planner` - Project specification generation (ALWAYS FIRST for new features)
- `claude-md-manager` - CLAUDE.md management (MANDATORY AFTER EVERY AGENT)
- `context-manager` - Context management (AT PHASE TRANSITIONS)
- `git-manager` - Git operations, GitHub management (AFTER EVERY TASK)

**ðŸŽ¯ Core Orchestrators:**
- `mcp-orchestrator` - Web research, external APIs, documentation
- `quality-security-orchestrator` - Security scans, code review (MANDATORY PHASE 3)
- `docs-orchestrator` - Documentation generation (MANDATORY PHASE 4)

**ðŸŽ¯ Domain Orchestrators:**
- `dev-architecture-orchestrator` - General development, architecture
- `infrastructure-ops-orchestrator` - Docker, cloud, CI/CD, deployment
- `data-ai-orchestrator` - ML, data processing, AI development
- `language-specialist-orchestrator` - Language-specific coordination
- `business-marketing-orchestrator` - Business, marketing, sales
- `seo-content-orchestrator` - SEO optimization, content strategy
- `specialized-domains-orchestrator` - Finance, legal, specialized domains

**ðŸŽ¯ Power Agents (75+ Specialists):**
Available through orchestrators for specific tasks:
- **Languages**: typescript-pro, javascript-pro, python-pro, golang-pro, java-pro, csharp-pro, rust-pro, cpp-pro, c-pro, php-pro, ruby-pro, elixir-pro, scala-pro, sql-pro, flutter-expert, ios-developer, unity-developer, minecraft-bukkit-pro
- **Architecture**: backend-architect, frontend-developer, mobile-developer, ui-ux-designer, graphql-architect, architect-review
- **Data & AI**: ai-engineer, ml-engineer, mlops-engineer, data-scientist, data-engineer, prompt-engineer
- **Infrastructure**: cloud-architect, kubernetes-architect, terraform-specialist, hybrid-cloud-architect, database-admin, database-optimizer, deployment-engineer, dx-optimizer, network-engineer, devops-troubleshooter, incident-responder
- **Quality**: security-auditor, code-reviewer, test-automator, performance-engineer, debugger, error-detective, search-specialist
- **Documentation**: docs-architect, api-documenter, tutorial-engineer, reference-builder, mermaid-expert
- **Business**: business-analyst, customer-support, sales-automator, legal-advisor, content-marketer, hr-pro
- **SEO**: seo-authority-builder, seo-structure-architect, seo-meta-optimizer, seo-cannibalization-detector, seo-content-refresher, seo-keyword-strategist, seo-content-planner, seo-content-writer, seo-content-auditor, seo-snippet-hunter
- **Specialized**: quant-analyst, risk-manager, payment-integration, legacy-modernizer

### Agent Delegation Rules
1. **NEVER** call power agents directly - use orchestrators
2. **ALWAYS** use master-developer-orchestrator as entry point
3. Orchestrators delegate to appropriate power agents automatically
4. Context is preserved through context-manager
5. Progress tracked through claude-md-manager
6. All changes committed through git-manager

### DO NOT USE Individual Agents Directly
Never bypass the master-developer-orchestrator to use individual agents.
Always let the orchestrator handle delegation to power agents.

## Architecture Decisions

### Framework Selection
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for modern async support, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and excellent performance
- **Pydantic v2**: Used for data validation and serialization with type hints
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for production-ready performance

### Data Storage Strategy
- **JSON Files**: Static files for truth and dare content (50+ items each)
- **In-Memory Caching**: Python dictionaries for fast access and filtering
- **Categories**: general, relationships, funny, deep, embarrassing (for truths)
- **Difficulty Levels**: easy, medium, hard (for dares)

### API Design Patterns
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard HTTP methods and resource-based URLs
- **Consistent Response Format**: Standardized JSON structure across all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with proper HTTP status codes
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive information exposure
- **Type Safety**: MyPy type checking for runtime safety

## Security Scan Results
- **Last Scan**: 2025-09-03T17:30:00Z
- **Status**: PASSED âœ…
- **Critical Issues**: 0 (Fixed: 0)
- **High Issues**: 0 (Fixed: 0)
- **Medium Issues**: 0 (Fixed: 0)
- **Low Issues**: 0 (Fixed: 0)
- **Files Scanned**: 7 application files
- **Test Coverage**: 84.49% (71 tests passing)
- **Security Tools**: Semgrep, Manual FastAPI security review
- **Vulnerabilities Fixed**: None found

### Security Assessment Summary
- **Input Validation**: âœ… Secure (Pydantic models with comprehensive validation)
- **Path Parameters**: âœ… Secure (Regex validation prevents injection)
- **CORS Configuration**: âœ… Secure (Properly configured origins)
- **Error Handling**: âœ… Secure (No stack traces exposed)
- **Data Sanitization**: âœ… Secure (UTF-8 encoding, path validation)
- **HTTP Status Codes**: âœ… Secure (Proper status codes used)
- **Logging**: âœ… Secure (No sensitive data exposed)

### Production Recommendations
- Add rate limiting for production deployment
- Implement security headers middleware (HSTS, CSP)
- Update Pydantic validators to V2 style
- Consider API authentication for production use
